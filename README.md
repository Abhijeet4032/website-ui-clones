# website-ui-clones
I’m currently learning frontend development and this repository is a collection of my beginner practice projects where I recreate the user interfaces of popular websites using only HTML and CSS. These clones are not fully functional websites, but visual recreations made to understand and practice core concepts like layout, positioning, flexbox, grid, responsiveness, styling, and clean file structure.  Each folder in this repo represents a separate project and shows my progress as I keep learning and improving my frontend skills. This is part of my journey to build a strong foundation in web development before moving on to JavaScript and more advanced tools and frameworks.
